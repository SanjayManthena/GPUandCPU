        <p>A graphics card is a component in a computer that generates and renders images, animations, and video for the display. It offloads these tasks from the CPU to enhance performance in graphics-intensive applications such as gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering.</p>
        <h2>What is a CPU?</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\manth\Desktop\Web_project\Images\CPU.jpg" alt="CPU" />
        <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the brain of the computer. It performs calculations and executes instructions to manage tasks and processes. The CPU is critical for the overall performance of a computer, handling everything from basic operations to complex computations.</p>
